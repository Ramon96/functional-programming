# Functional Programming
![Maskers op functie](https://github.com/Ramon96/functional-programming/blob/master/documentation/project.png?raw=true)

# Concept
The Idea is to make a data visualisation that represents the mask per function around the world. The ideo is to be able to spot pattern's and get an idea what we can do with all this data.

# Description
During this course I created a data visualisation with the help of VizHub. Building this project Data of the NMVW was used.
This project is made with [D3](https://d3js.org/)

# Target Audience
This visualisation was build in mind for someone to find pattern's in the data. This could easily be replaced with another subject to get a better understanding of the collection. This would benefit someone like Rik.

# Installation
You want to clone this project to a local folder using the following code. 
`https://github.com/Ramon96/functional-programming.git`

# .gitignore
The data cleanup contains some very sensetive information. 
Please don't dox your class mates and make use of a gitignore.

 # Data
 The data used in this project is data acuired from the NMVW database collection with the use of Sparql.
 I am getting the Mask by function. They also require to have a lat and long value.
