# Description
During this course I created a data visualisation with the help of VizHub. Building this project Data of the NMVW was used.
This project is made with [D3](https://d3js.org/)

# Target Audience
This visualisation was build in mind for someone to find pattern's in the data. This could easily be replaced with another subject to get a better understanding of the collection. This would benefit someone like Rik.
